# BEKMP: A Blockchain-Enabled Key Management Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks

The repository contains the blockchain component of the BEKMP paper. This paper introduces a novel key management protocol tailored for clustered Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs). Hyperledger Fabric is employed in this part of the repository for the blockchain functionality. 

The key management is designed using ECQV certificates, which considerably reduces Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) overhead. Additionally, the protocol integrates the Hashed One-pass Menezes-QuVanstone (HOMQV) protocol with blockchain technology to enhance key exchange security against active attacks. The ECC code can be found in https://github.com/juvebogdan/BEKMP-ECC-benchmarking

The blockchain network code can be found in bekmp-network folder
